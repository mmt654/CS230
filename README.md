Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Client was looking to build a game that could be hosted from a host server that the Gaming Room would provide. With this software They wanted the game to allow for unique     team names that could be added later during the round, Also users could check to see if the name was already in use. Another requirement would be that the game would be web       based  and could be cross platform or run on multiple platforms.  

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I would say I enjoyed and did particularly well is the server side and client side comparison between different operating systems and development requirments by using good         comparisions and using sources to form the best idea of the development requirments. 
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  I would say the most helpful part with designing code would be laying out the design constraints and laying out the model since that would kind of give the box you have to work   in and what the requirments have to be.
  
If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would say the recommendations, I would improve it by trying to be a little more objective and going into greater detail on other operatings systems and how they could work and   help with running the software. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  I took into account the fact they wanted the application to be multiplatform to reach more users and to also allow multiple teams to work on the appplication. Also that with       multiple teams working on the application I tried to make the code accessible for multiple platforms. 
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I followed the design constraints and tried to add comments outlining what the code was doing for future work on the software. I would follow design constrints and build a box     or an outline to stay in if I were to work on a similar software in the future.
